      <h3>what's your opinion?</h3> <br>
      <p>i’m designing functions to clean data for two separate pipelines: one has small string inputs, the other has medium-size pandas inputs. both pipelines require the same manipulations.

        for example, which is a better design: clean_v0 or clean_v1?
        
        that is, should i standardize object types inside or outside the cleaning function?
        
        thanks all! this community has been a life saver :)</p>

      <h3>What is expected of me as a Junior Data Engineer in 2025?</h3> <br>
      <p>Hello all,

        I've been interviewing for a proper Junior Data Engineer position and have been doing well in the rounds so far. I've done my recruiter call, HR call and coding assessment. Waiting on the 4th.
        
        I want to be great. I am willing to learn from those of you who are more experienced than me.
        
        Can anyone share examples from their own careers on attitude, communication, soft skills, time management, charisma, willingness to learn and other soft skills that I should keep in mind. Or maybe what I should not do instead.
        
        How should I approach the technical side? There are 1000's of technologies to learn. So I have been learning basics with soft skills and hoping everything works out.
        
        3 years ago I had a labour job and did well in that too. So this grind has caused me to rewire my brain to work in tech and corporate work. I am aiming for 20 years more in this field.
        
        Any insights are appreciated.
        
        Thanks!
        
        Edit: great resources in the comments. Thank you 🙏</p>

      <h3>What's the best method for a a non data analyst to create a program to clean up messy data?</h3> <br>
      <p>I sell used car parts on eBay, and one of the hardest parts of it is knowing what parts to get when I'm walking around a junkyard. I can get scraped data from eBay of parts that are selling, but the issue is that the data is extremely messy and no one follows a consistent listing format. If I wanted to make this data usable so that I can actually comb through it and use it, how much would it cost to pay someone to develop something like this for me?

        I tried to use AI to generate code for me, and can get it working, but I don't have any programming knowledge outside of some basics, so it's always super janky.</p> <br>

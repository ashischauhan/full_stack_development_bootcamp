// Variables in JavaScript
// Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, variables can be declared using `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords.
// `let` is used for variables that can change, `const` is for constants that won't change, and `var` is function-scoped or globally scoped.
// Example of variable declaration and initialization
// Using `let` for variables that can change
let userAge = 25; // Using let for a variable that can change
let userName = "Ashis";
// Using `const` for constants that won't change
const userCountry = "India"; // Using const for a constant value
const accountId = 14435;
// Using `var` for variables that can be re-declared and updated

var accountPassword = "12345";
var accountCity = "Jaipur";
// Using `var` allows re-declaration and updating

// accountId = 2;

console.log([accountCity, accountId, accountEmail]);
// Output: [ 'Jaipur', 14435, undefined ]
